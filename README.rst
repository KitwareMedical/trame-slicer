============
trame-slicer
============

trame-slicer is a Python library bringing `3D Slicer <https://github.com/Slicer/Slicer/>_` components in trame as a
composable library.

It uses 3D Slicer's python wrapping and adds a thin wrapping to make it available with the
`trame framework <https://github.com/Kitware/trame/>_`.

Warning
-------

As the 3D Slicer Python wheel is not yet generated by the 3D Slicer CI, manually generated
wheels are provided for Python 3.10 for Windows and Linux.

The API has not been stabilized / reviewed by the 3D Slicer core developers so please use
this library with caution.
